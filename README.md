# WebXR_P5js_eCampus21

WebXR_P5js is a template for embedding [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches inside a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) WebXR-ready scene for VR and desktop display. 

This is one of three projects developed in parallel by OCAD University and York University researchers with the goal of providing students of varying educational backgrounds and skillsets with the necessary toolkits to quickly produce WebXR envrironments for their creative media projects. 

The project is officially hosted on [Github](https://github.com/worldmaking/WebXR_P5js_eCampus21)
